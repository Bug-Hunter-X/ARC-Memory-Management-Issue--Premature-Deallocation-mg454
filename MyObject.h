In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider a scenario where you have a custom class 'MyObject' and you create an instance within a method. If this instance is not explicitly retained (using a strong property or variable), and it's not returned from the method, the instance might be deallocated prematurely before its usage, leading to a crash.
